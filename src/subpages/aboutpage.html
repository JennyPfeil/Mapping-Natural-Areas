        <p>The Wayfinding Project, a part of the Trinity Sustainability Initiative, is a project by and for students at
            the University of Toronto. The project is dedicated to make Toronto’s natural areas more
            approachable, through our map, website content, and various community-building initiatives.</p>
        <p> We aim to have a student-centred approach that gives students the agency to feel informed and comfortable
            approaching nature. This means including campus-specific greenspaces, addressing student concerns directly,
            and providing information on access needs such as transportation, study spaces, and facilities available
            at the greenspaces.</p>
        <p>To use the map, simply select filters that are relevant to your needs and discover greenspaces throughout
            the GTA that address your criteria. You can find more information on each space by navigating to the
            webpage linked to its location on the map.</p>
        <p>Our data is collected primarily through student volunteers that have explored greenspaces in their area. We
            have held Urban Nature Blitzes and surveys to facilitate this data collection. For the future, we hope to
            promote and create student initiatives, foster community through nature on campus, and connect students
            with their local natural environment.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the Wayfinding Project is to help facilitate student engagement with nature, so we welcome
            feedback on how to make that more applicable to our student population. Should you have any suggestions for
            information you don’t see in our app or website, please []!</p>
